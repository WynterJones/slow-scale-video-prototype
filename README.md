# Slow Scale YouTube API Prototype

A 2 step web page protprototype for the YouTube API and a slow scale effect.

The first step is a simple Headline and Play button. This button will trigger:

- Slow fade in of the video
- Slow scale of the video
- Progress bar
- Redirect to URL after video is finished
- Play video and play blurred background video

The effect is a prototype to see if you can slowly get a viewer to be pay more attention to the video being played so that they are actually paying attention so when the video ends and redirects it will be more likely to be seen.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
